                      PREPROC VERSION RELEASE NOTES

April 2, 1998

Added hook for processing of LBA field campaign data.

April 12, 1998

Fixed bug in calculation of range and azimuth in rgmin

Wednesday, January 21, 1998
---------------------------------------------
1) DBW modified preproc.pl to work with TAM data
2) DBW modified tam.f so that it now works correctly
3) DBW added get_site.f (removing it from preproc.f)
4) DBW modified Makefile so that default TOPDIR is ${TRMM},
   ${TRMM} must be specified in the user's path.
5) Version tested on SGI. Noted some warnings, should be checked

Wednesday, November 26, 1997
----------------------------------------------
1) BLF modified RGMIN so that it no longer exits program after finding
   an unknown file. 
2) DBW Cleaned up the preproc.pl program so that it doesn't write too much.
3) Test changes on SGI and HP. All OK.

Monday, October 27, 1997: BLF
----------------------------------------------
1) Added c function daylight_savings_time to preproc.  This function 
   returns a flag as whether DST is in effect or not (TRUE = 1, FALSE = 0).
   This flag affects the determination of the offset between local time 
   and UTC.
2) Updated Makefile

Tuesday, October 21, 1997: DBW
----------------------------------------------
1) Found a bad bug in preproc.pl which was causing to erroneously
   modify all files as if they were HAR files. Fixed.
2) Finally got time function working. Found a bug in the old time
   function that only reared its ugly head on the SGI, causing 
   erroneous values for julday. Now, julday and get_date have
   been streamlined and fixed.

Thursday, October 9, 1997: DBW
----------------------------------------------
1) Modified time.f in the preproc directory. This now contains more
   streamlined and more efficient routines for calculating julian day,
   from month, day and year, and returning the month and day given the
   Julian day and year. 
   
2) Cleaned up the ANY2UTC code, but have not changed its main functionality
   yet. Some sites, (it appears only Harris County) record their data in 
   local time, sometimes LST and sometimes DST. It seems that the best way
   to handle this is to have the subroutine any2utc handle it via a passed
   flag that says "Hey, this site uses DST, account for it when you change
   the times"

Friday, October 1, 1997: DBW
----------------------------------------------
1) Modified preproc.pl so that it correctly creates temp files and then
   writes them over the original data.

2) Added comments to the code.

3) Harris County data now works. To get working on SGI I had to 
   make sure that all rain rates are floating point values. Sometimes
   they were integers.

4) Modified/improved the INSTALL script.

Sunday, September 28, 1997: DBW
----------------------------------------------
1) Raw data sometimes has integer valued rain rates. The subroutine
   har.f will bomb upon encountering a non-real value. A modification
   was made to preproc.pl to make sure that all records are the 
   appropriate format.

2) gsp/preproc/Preproc.txt now includes info on the above fix.

3) The file gsp/preproc/file.list was removed from the repository.

4) A bug in preproc.pl when opening the MODFILE was fixed. This
   bug caused a pipe symbol "|" to be added to the temporary filenames.

5) The temporary files are now kept in pwd, rather than in the
   data/raw/NNN/ directory. 

6) This file "CHANGES" was changed to list from the most current
   to the least current update.

7) Wrote script "create_gmin_from_raw.pl" which is Perl program to
   run both preproc and rgmin. The interface to the preproc.pl
   program. 
   NOTE: You must have create_gmin_from_raw.pl, preproc.pl, preproc,
         rgmin.pl and rgmin executables in your path to run this
         program successfully.

8) Wrote csh script "INSTALL_SCRIPT" that does a make clean, make and
   make install on preproc and rgmin. The script assumes that the
   Makefile for each program are correct for installation directory,
   cpu type, etc. 

September 04,1997: BLF - Release Version 1.1
----------------------------------------------
1) Completed preproc and rgmin modules for ingesting Harris County data

2) Several bug fixes related to multiple tip QC, processing of St Johns data.

3) Fixed bug in Darwin double tip checking module.

3) Expanded header to include additional fields (GV_Site, product type)

4) streamlined source code

5) cleaned up standard output

6) Added module to treat old KSC and old KWA (KSO & KWO)

7) changed command line arguments on rgmin.  No longer require the year.

June 10, 1997
----------------------------------------------
1) Added README file. Began HTML documentation.

2) Added CHANGES file (this file).

3) Added TODO file. Should be used with this file to make sure
   that all necessary changes are being taken care of.

4) Cleaned up the Makefile. Is much more generic now and has 
   four, well-identified configuration sections.

5) Package

6) CVS set for TRMM GSP version 1.0

June 1, 1997: BLF & DBW: Release Version 1.0
----------------------------------------------
1) Grouped subroutines and separated them from the main line.

2) Now use a rgmin.par file, rather than PARAMETER statements
   repeated in each routine.

3) Added documentation directory with limited html doc.

4) Tested program using 20 years of requested data storage (45 MB).
