This package  is used to create gmin files from raw GV rain gauge data. 
The raw data has been processed via the program preproc. 
The pre-processed data is then converted to one-minute rain rates with
the program RGMIN.

The input data are read from and written to a pre-defined disk directory 
structure. The DIRECTORY given at the command line is assumed 
to be the parent directory containing a data sub-directory 
structure as follows:

	data/gag/
	data/gmin/
	data/raw/
			CSC/
			DSC/
			HAR/
			KSC/
			KWA/
			LBA/
			MSC/
			OMK/
			RMI/
			STJ/
			TAM/
			TFB/
			TFT/
	data/docs
	data/sitelist
			CSC_loc.dat/
			DSC_loc.dat/
			HAR_loc.dat/
			KSC_loc.dat/
			KWA_loc.dat/
			LBA_loc.dat
			MSC_loc.dat/
			OMK_loc.dat/
			RMI_loc.dat/
			STJ_loc.dat/
			TAM_loc.dat/
			TFB_loc.dat/
			TFT_loc.dat/
			radar.dat

Notes:

1) The raw tip records are to be placed in the data/raw/NNN directory,
where NNN is the network identifier. 

2) The sitelists, which contain the gauge number, gauge name, longitude 
(deg, minutes and seconds) and latitude (degrees, minutes and seconds) are 
placed in the data/sitelist/NNN_loc.dat files.

3) A special file, data/sitelist/radar.dat contains the lat, lon and four
letter identifier for the principal radar for each network.

4) The output of the preproc program will be placed in the data/gag 
directory. Note that the program preproc.pl will clean this directory
upon every execution, so processed data should be moved accordingly.

5) The output of the RGMIN proram will be placd in the data/gmin
directory. Note that the program preproc.pl will clean this directory
upon every execution, so processed data should be moved accordingly.
