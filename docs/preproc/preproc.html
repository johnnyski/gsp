<H2 ALIGN=LEFT>Description</H2>
<P> PREPROC ingests raw data received from TRMM GV sites and produces 
intermediate data products used as input to RGMIN (Cubic Spline 
Interpolation of 1-minute rain rates from tip increments of rainfall).  
This program was subsequently designed to treat the specific data 
formats unique to each GV site and produce an ouput format consistent 
with the resolution of a given site.  It should be noted that the gag 
file format is not universal for all sites since the data attributes, 
such as the resolution at which the data is recorded, differ from site 
to site.  The objective of preproc is to write the data out to a format 
that is both which is easily ingestible by RGMIN.  Some sites, such 
as Darwin, also require some rudimentary preprocessing of the raw data.  
GV sites currently supported by this software are listed below:

<H4>Rain Gauge Network - Network ID</H4>
<UL>
	<LI> Darwin (Cscale, Dscale, Mscale)      		    - CSC, DSC, MSC
	<LI> Melbourne, Florida (KSC, St Johns)   		    - KSC, STJ
	<LI> Kwajalein (Royal Marshall Is., Kwajalein) 	    - RMI, KWA
	<LI> Texas (Harris County, Texas A&M Mesonet)	    - HAR, TAM
	<LI> Thailand (Om Koi)							    - OMK
	<LI> Old Gems Format (KSC, Kwajalein before 1997)   - KSO, KWO 
</UL>

<H2> Usage</H2>
	PREPROC is executed through a perl script interface. The perl 
  	script preproc.pl, looks through the data directory path (given)
  	on the command line, creates an input directive file preproc.inp
  	and then executes the application (from preproc.f). There are
	four command line arguments that are passed to the perl script,
	described below.

	<p>
	<b>NOTE: </b>Make sure the year you enter is correct for the
		data you provide in the RAW directory. This is currently
		a weak link in the program, and will be fixed in a later
		release. 
	<UL>
	<LI><H4>preproc.pl DIRECTORY SITEID YEAR VERBOSE</H4>
		DIRECTORY is the directory path above data/ <BR>
		SITEID: 3 Character site identification (See above)<BR>
		YEAR: beginning year of data<BR>
		VERBOSE is the verbose flag (1 = verbose, 0 = nonverbose).<BR>
	</UL>
