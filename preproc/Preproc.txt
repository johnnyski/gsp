Description:

PREPROC ingests raw data received from TRMM GV sites and produces a second 
level of intermediate data products used as input to RGMIN (Cubic Spline 
Interpolation of 1 - minute rain rates from tip increments of rainfall).  This
program was subsequently designed to treat the specific data formats unique to 
each GV site and produce an ouput format consistent with the resolution of a 
given site.  It should be noted that the gag file format is not universal for 
all sites since the data attributes, such as the resolution at which the data 
is recorded, differ from site to site.  The objective of preproc is to write 
the data out to a format that is both compatible with file attributes and 
which is easily ingestible by RGMIN.  Some sites, such as Darwin, also
require some rudimentary preprocessing of the raw data.  GV sites currently 
supported by this software are listed below:

Rain Gauge Network - Network ID
===============================
Darwin (Cscale, Dscale, Mscale)                 - CSC, DSC, MSC
Melbourne, Florida (KSC, St Johns)              - KSC, STJ
Kwajalein (Royal Marshall Is., Kwajalein)       - RMI, KWA
Texas (Harris County, Texas A&M Mesonet)        - HAR, TAM
Thailand (Om Koi)                               - OMK
Old Gems Format (KSC, Kwajalein before 1997)    - KSO, KWO 

NOTES:

1) HAR data sometimes has an integer valued rain rate, which will cause
   har.f to crash. A fix was placed in preproc.pl to rewrite the data in
   a consistent format.

Usage:

Preproc is executed through a Perl script interface.

Command:
preproc.pl DIRECTORY SITEID YEAR VERBOSE

arguments:
    DIRECTORY above the data/ directory
    SITEID  3 Character site identification (See Above) 
    YEAR beginning year of data
    VERBOSE is the verbose flag (1 = verbose, 0 = nonverbose).

(e.g. preproc.pl /data/gauge/ KSC 97 1)
